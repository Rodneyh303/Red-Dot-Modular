# East: per-voice LOR over the mono VARIATION / LEGATO probability

**Status: DESIGN ONLY. Nothing implemented.** Dev lives on `integration/east-extra-lanes` until the
idea is proven good. Do not merge to master on the strength of this document.

Origin: Rodney — *"allow per channel LOR on the mono probability for the extra lanes."* The kind of
thing a thoughtful user would ask for, which is a reason to take it seriously and a reason not to rush it.

---

## 1. The idea in one line

The two lanes East lacks (VARIATION, LEGATO) are **mono-only**. Rather than give each poly voice its own
probability data for them, give each voice its own **LOR window** (length / offset / rotation) onto the
*shared mono* probability array:

```
voice v, lane L ∈ {VAR, LEG}, step s:
    p = random_[0][L][ lorIndex( lorStore_[v][L], s ) ]
                ^ mono data          ^ per-voice view
```

No new probability storage. A per-voice **view** of a shared shape — the same trick that makes
length-6-against-length-12 produce multi-bar patterns, applied to articulation rather than pitch.

---

## 2. What already exists (verified, not assumed)

| Thing | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `lorStore_[16][6][3]` — 16 voices × 6 editor lanes × (len/off/rot) | **slots `[v][4]`, `[v][5]` allocated, unused** | `SequencerEngine.hpp:135` |
| `random_[16][6][16]` — same shape for probability | allocated; poly VAR/LEG unused | `PatternEngine.hpp:78` |
| *"editorLane 0..5 = MEL,OCT,REST,ACC,VAR,LEG (poly uses only 0..3; VAR/LEG are mono-only)"* | comment states it outright | `SequencerEngine.hpp:127` |
| Each `PolyVoice` owns its **own `GateState`** | yes — independent holds structurally supported | `SequencerEngine.hpp:36` |
| Editor `laneCount` is a plain field; `laneHeightF() = laneAreaH()/laneCount` | 6 lanes works with no editor change | `SandsVisualEditorV4.hpp:263,270` |

The probability-modifier unification (the `lorStore_`/`random_` arc) allocated these slots. This feature
is largely *claiming space the refactor already made*.

## 3. The panel fits exactly

After the `SandsGrid` unification (`src/ui/SandsGrid.hpp`, `LANE_H = 14`):

```
East / Macro lanes end at  70 mm
Mono lanes end at          98 mm
gap                        28 mm  =  2 × LANE_H   exactly
```

East's empty band below its lanes is **precisely two lanes tall**. Adding VAR + LEG makes East a 6-lane
editor on the identical grid to Mono (14..98). The space isn't being *filled*; it was the right size all
along. (Macro is different — its send group occupies that band. Macro would stay 4-lane.)

---

## 4. The two lanes are NOT equally safe

### 4a. CORRECTION — there is only ONE coherent option, and it is coupled to LEGATO

An earlier draft of this note posed a choice: per-voice `nvIdx`, or "variation-bias only". **The second
does not exist.** From source:

```cpp
float r_vary = pe.variationRandom[ getVariationStep() ];   // mono LOR-transformed step
int   nvIdx  = getNoteLenIdx(noteVal, input, r_vary);      // → pe.varyNoteIndex(baseIdx, in, r)
```

`varyNoteIndex(baseIdx, variationAmount, r)`: the **knob** (`in.variationAmount`) sets how WIDE the window
of reachable note-length indices is; the **array value** `r` picks WHICH variant inside it. VARIATION *is*
the note-length bias. There is no separate bias to move without moving `nvIdx`.

So the feature is exactly one thing, and it is a good shape:

> **The window stays global (mono VARIATION knob). The pick within it becomes per-voice.**
> *How much* variation is one musical decision; *which* variant each voice takes is where polyphony lives.
> At `variationAmount == 0.5` `varyNoteIndex` returns `baseIdx` unchanged — so the feature is SILENT until
> the knob is turned up. No toggle needed for backwards compatibility; old patches are bit-identical.

**THE COUPLING (this is the real finding).** `nvIdx` reaches `gs.slideMax(pitchV, semitone, nvIdx)`, which
sets `holdRemain`. Per-voice `nvIdx` ⇒ per-voice hold length. Legato/tie **rides on hold**
(`holdRemain >= 1.f` is the phrase-spanning guard; ties extend holds; `prevSlur` tracks committed slurs).

**Therefore VARIATION and LEGATO cannot be cleanly staged apart.** Doing VARIATION per-voice already
perturbs the quantity LEGATO depends on. The earlier claim "VARIATION is low risk, do it first" was wrong.

### 4b. What the current model actually is (and why it may be deliberate)

| shared from mono | per-voice |
|---|---|
| `nvIdx` (note length) | rest decision |
| `legatoProb` (tie/slur) | accent decision |
| `scale` | pitch draw |

Rest is *subtractive*. Accent is *decorative*. Pitch is *within the shared scale*. **None move the clock.**
`nvIdx` and `legatoProb` are the only two that do, because both feed `holdRemain`. The boundary looks like
a principle, not an oversight:

> Poly voices may subtract, decorate, and choose pitches within the shared key —
> but they may not move the clock or leave the scale.

That is what makes the poly voices read as *one line, thinned and coloured sixteen ways* rather than sixteen
sequencers. Note that the two lanes East lacks are **precisely the two structural ones**. Lifting the
boundary is a MODEL CHANGE, not a feature.

### 4c. THE MIDDLE GROUND — per-voice articulation, clamped to the mono event grid

Each voice derives its own `nvIdx` through its own LOR window, **but `holdRemain` is clamped so a voice can
never hold past the next mono event.** The clock stays mono's. Legato's invariants never see a divergent
hold, because divergent holds cannot occur.

You hear: attacks tight (all voices land together), releases scattered (each lets go at its own time).
Articulation stratification — sustain / tenuto / staccato across a chord. Gate length is what envelopes
see, so with Changi's 16 individual gate outs this becomes per-voice **timbre**.

Emergent, for free: the clamp is "hold until mono's next note", so **dense passages force every voice short
and sparse passages let voices stretch into the gaps.** Articulation follows rhythmic density with no
programming. That the safety mechanism produces a musical behaviour is a good sign it is the right
constraint.

It cannot do: independent lines, counterpoint, polyrhythm, sounding through a mono rest. It stays *one line,
sixteen articulations*.

**MPE framing (Rodney):** this is exactly per-note expression — one note event, per-voice articulation.
The clamped model is the shape MPE controllers and DAW note-expression already assume.

## 5. Staging

1. **Panel + editor only — DONE (this branch).** East → 6 lanes (`ED_H` 56 → 84, `setLaneCount(6)`), same
   14..98 band as Mono. Lanes 4/5 render but are **LOCKED / display-only**. (They previously fell through
   `laneLockedFn`'s `editorLane >= 4 → false`, i.e. *editable*, purely because they were never displayed —
   fixed here.) Zero data change, zero behaviour change. Answers the cheap question: does a 6-lane East
   look right?
2. **Clamped per-voice articulation (§4c).** Per-voice `nvIdx` via per-voice LOR, `holdRemain` clamped to
   the next mono event. Legato invariants untouched by construction. Default off; silent anyway at
   `variationAmount == 0.5`.
3. **Unclamped** — only if 2 sounds *nearly* right and you want voices to breathe across the bar. This is
   the model change. Re-derive `holdRemain >= 1.f`, `legatoLeadingEdge`, `restBeatsLegato`/`prevSlur`
   per voice. By ear, on this branch.
4. Merge only once 2 is proven by ear. Stage 3 may never be wanted, and that is a fine outcome.

Each stage is independently revertible. Stage 1 alone answers "does a 6-lane East look right", which is
the cheap question.

## 6. Why this might be a genuinely good idea

Rodney's own report: setting LOR lane lengths to 6 and 12 with three poly voices yields multi-bar patterns
that repeat over long cycles. That effect comes from **coprime-ish rotation periods sliding past each
other**, not from randomness. Extending per-voice LOR to VARIATION does the same thing to *articulation*:
voices share one underlying shape but read it at different phases, so note-value and gate length
desynchronise over many bars while remaining musically related.

The strongest argument is economy — one shared probability array, sixteen views. The strongest argument
*against* is that LEGATO's invariants are load-bearing and were not written with this in mind.

## 7. Open questions

- VARIATION: per-voice `nvIdx` (and therefore gate length), or variation-bias only? **Blocking.**
- Should Macro also gain the lanes? Its send group occupies the band; probably not.
- Does per-voice legato interact with the parked `StrandLedger CONFLICT MACRO then EAST` bug?
- Persistence: `lorStore_[v][4..5]` presumably already serialises (whole-array). Confirm; patch breaks
  don't matter (no users), but silent zeros would.
